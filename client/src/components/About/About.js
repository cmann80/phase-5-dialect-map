        <p>Dialect Map is a web page where you can post some 
            information on where you live or have lived and how you speak English,
            so that others can compare it to their own. It is not a serious academic project,
            but I hope it will generate some fun conversations about diversity of language.</p>

        <p>Though some dialects have more distinctions between sounds and words than others, when they are taken as a whole, all of them are equal in value and expressiveness.</p>
        
        <p>Most of the survey questions are based on the <a href="http://dialect.redlog.net/">Harvard Dialect Survey.</a></p>
