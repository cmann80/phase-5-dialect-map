        <p>Dialect Map is a web page where you can post some 
            information on where you live or have lived and how you speak English,
            so that others can compare it to their own. It is not a serious academic project,
            but I hope it will generate some fun conversations about diversity of language.
            Remember: all languages and dialects are equal in value and expressiveness.</p>
